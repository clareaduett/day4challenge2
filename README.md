Application of python recursion

Recursion ( for the recursion exercises learners are expected to write their own tests).

Write a python program that sums items in a list, the list can contain integers and lists of integers. 

Power(a, b) is a function that calculates the mathematical ‘a’ raised to a power ‘b’. Using recursion provide  a python implementation of the power(a,b) function. 

For example:
power(3, 4)  # returns 81 which is (3 * 3 * 3 * 3)
power(2, 3) # returns 8 which is (2 * 2 * 2 )
